# Exploratory Data Analysis Collections

### Author : Gukhwan Hyun

## Introduction
This repository is my collections of Exploratory Data Analysis on subjects I find interesting or helpful.
I'd like to pursue my career in data science and I believe getting my hands dirty with real-life data is good way to kick it off :)
BTW, This is an ongoing and long-term project so if you don't see anything interesting at the moment, please come back later for new updates!

## Topic 1 : Video_Streaming_Platforms
If you want to watch your favorite/popular moives or TV shows, your go to method would be to subscribe to some streaming services.
But there are now too many streaming platforms that we are pretty much living in the age of streaming. 
In addtion, they often use "Exclusive" contents to lure you in. So how would you decide which streaming platform is the best fit for you?
